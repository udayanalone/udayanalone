# Hey there, I’m Udayan! 👋  

I’m a **third-year Computer Engineering student** at **KKWIEER, Nashik**, trying to balance coding, learning, and a little bit of procrastination (oops!).

### 🎯 Who am I?  
- A curious tech enthusiast who loves building apps using **C++**, **Java**, and **React Native**.  
- Someone who occasionally swaps studying for **gaming, binge-watching**, or dreaming up app ideas.  
- Always looking for **new challenges** and fun projects to collaborate on!  

---

### 🚀 What I’m up to:  
- Exploring **React Native** to create awesome mobile apps.  
- Working on mastering backend integration to make apps smarter and more dynamic.  
- Dreaming up my next side project (because who doesn’t love a good “What if...?” moment?).

### 🌟 Fun facts about me:  
- **Study breaks = Creativity boosts**: My best ideas usually show up when I’m doing *literally anything* other than studying.  
- I think of debugging as detective work—it’s frustrating but weirdly satisfying when I crack the case.  
- I believe learning isn’t always about books. Sometimes, it’s about trying, failing, and laughing about it later.
